Learn Java 11
=============

[![Continuous Integration](https://github.com/mpuening/learn-java11/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mpuening/learn-java11/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

This project contains test cases that I made for me to learn some of the new Java 11 
(and 9 & 10) features.

It serves the purpose for me to have examples to reference for various APIs.

* HTTP Client API
* Single File Source Code Scripts
* Collection Factory Methods
